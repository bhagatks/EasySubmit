# Action Items

> **Production deploy:** intentionally **deferred** — continue local dev + extension work; revisit this section when ready to ship.

## Deploy to Vercel (deferred)

| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Fix production build (`npm run build`) | Done | Extension page + lucide `Github` → `Code2` |
| Connect GitHub repo to Vercel | Deferred | `bhagatks/EasySubmit` |
| Set production env vars in Vercel | Deferred | See `.env.vercel.example` (Supabase `yofgnflcqajqsepbfdkc`) |
| Set QA/preview env vars (optional) | Deferred | Vercel Preview: use dev Supabase vars from `.env.example` |
| Set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to prod domain | Deferred | Must match deployed URL exactly |
| Google OAuth redirect URI | Done | Prod callbacks registered |
| LinkedIn OAuth redirect URI | Done | Prod callbacks registered |
| Run Prisma migrate on production DB | Blocked — P3009 | See `docs/MIGRATION_RECOVERY.md` — resolve before prod cutover |
| Supabase Storage bucket `resumes` | Deferred | Private, authenticated upload |
| Supabase Storage bucket `avatars` (public read) + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Needed for prod avatar upload | Dev falls back to `public/avatars/`; see `lib/profile/avatar-storage.ts` |

## Post-deploy smoke test (when prod ships)

- [ ] `/login` — Google OAuth completes → `/onboarding/step-1`
- [ ] `/onboarding` — wizard steps advance
- [ ] Resume upload → `/onboarding/step-4` animation → `/dashboard`
- [ ] Unauthenticated `/dashboard` → `/login`

## Follow-up (not blocking deploy)

- Add `@testing-library/react` harness for onboarding UI (see sidepanel rule pattern)
